## Overview
This challenge is worth to practice grid layout and basic javascript for your projects. I have caught some problems at the first time doing the challenge and so I have to take some time to reviews my knowledge again (learn new things also). 
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
